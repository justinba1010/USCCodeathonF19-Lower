# Counting Sheep

Brady needs a program to help him fall asleep. He has gotten tired of counting
sheep by hand. Instead he would like a program that counts for him.

## Description

Given a number, output a string to standard out that will emulate Brady's
lullaby of "1 sheep... 2 sheep ... n sheep".

## Input

The first line contains an integer $$n$$, the number of sheep it takes to help
Brady go to sleep.

## Constraints

$$0 \leq n \leq 10^4$$

## Output

Print the lullaby according to the number of sheep given, starting at $$1$$, and
ending at $$n$$, discluding all $$n\leq 0$$.

### Sample Output 1
