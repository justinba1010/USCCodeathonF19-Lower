generate a truth table for a given number of variables
output the given row number truth value

input is numberOfVariables rowNumber

example 1:
2 3
would output T F
because the first row is F F, second is F T and the third row of the truth table when using two variables is T F
A       B
F       F 
F       T
T       F <----
T       T

example 2:
  A       B       C
1 F       F       F 
2 F       F       T
3 F       T       F 
4 F       T       T
5 T       F       F
6 T       F       T
7 T       T       F
8 T       T       T

Truth tables in this problem always start with all variables as false

example 2

################ make the number of variables really high, but ask for a small 
row number to only look for that row / up to that row

OR

using genius solution of using mod % to only find certain spot




Problem 2
Sliding on Ice
given inputs position of solid objects 
navigate the player from starting position [shown by 2] using input 
directions
left right up down

the player moves until a solid object is hit, or the edge of the board is hit
solid object is shown as 1, empty space is shown as 0

output the ending coordinates
with 0,0 being in the bottom left [first column, bottom row]

##########(potentially add arrows that shift the player by 1 row or column,
 then continue in the 
  direction they were going)

given the input
200010001
000000000
100000010
010110101
right
down
right
up
left


would make the player end up at this position
000012001
000000000
100000010
010110101

the state of the board after each move is 
right
000210001
000000000
100000010
010110101

down
000010001
000000000
100200010
010110101

right
000010001
000000000
100000210
010110101

up
000010201
000000000
100000010
010110101

left
000012001
000000000
100000010
010110101

and the output would be 
5 3
